    <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-gray-700">
      Modern Physics is a fascinating yet challenging part of the JEE Physics syllabus. Topics like Photoelectric effect, Bohr’s model, Radioactivity, and X-rays often intimidate students due to their conceptual depth and mathematical rigor. However, with a focused 15-day study plan, you can confidently master Modern Physics and boost your JEE score significantly. This guide will break down a day-wise strategy, study tips, and practice methods to help you ace Modern Physics efficiently.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mt-6 mb-4">Why Modern Physics Matters for JEE</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Modern Physics usually carries around 8–12 marks in JEE Main and even higher weight in Advanced. Many questions are conceptual but can have numerical twists that test your understanding. Topics such as Photoelectric effect, Atomic models, and Radioactive decay are repeatedly tested. Scoring well here is often easier than complex mechanics or electromagnetism topics if you approach your study correctly.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mt-6 mb-4">Day 1-3: Basics and Photoelectric Effect</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Start with the fundamental concepts of photons, light’s dual nature, and Einstein’s photoelectric equation:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-800">
      <li>Understand the concept of photons and quantization of light energy.</li>
      <li>Memorize and derive the photoelectric equation \( hf = \phi + KE_{max} \).</li>
      <li>Practice problems calculating threshold frequency, stopping potential, and maximum kinetic energy.</li>
      <li>Focus on the effect of intensity and frequency on photoelectron emission.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Use simple conceptual questions and numerical problems from standard JEE books and past year papers.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mt-6 mb-4">Day 4-6: Atomic Models and Bohr’s Theory</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Dive into Bohr’s model of the hydrogen atom:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-800">
      <li>Understand quantization of angular momentum and energy levels.</li>
      <li>Memorize key formulas: energy of nth orbit, radius of orbit, frequency of emitted photon.</li>
      <li>Derive spectral line formula and relate it to transitions between energy levels.</li>
      <li>Practice problems on calculating radius, energy, and wavelengths of spectral lines.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Visualize electron transitions and spectral emissions. This will help solve conceptual questions and numerical problems efficiently.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mt-6 mb-4">Day 7-9: Radioactivity and Nuclear Physics</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Focus on radioactive decay laws and nuclear reactions:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-800">
      <li>Understand decay constant, half-life, mean life, and their interrelations.</li>
      <li>Learn and apply exponential decay law: \( N = N_0 e^{-\lambda t} \).</li>
      <li>Practice calculating remaining nuclei, activity, and time for decay.</li>
      <li>Get familiar with alpha, beta, and gamma decay, including nuclear equations.</li>
      <li>Explore binding energy and mass defect concepts with sample problems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mt-6 mb-4">Day 10-12: X-rays and Dual Nature of Matter</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Understand the origin and properties of X-rays:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-800">
      <li>Study production of X-rays through braking radiation and characteristic lines.</li>
      <li>Learn about the continuous and discrete spectra.</li>
      <li>Explore the wavelength cutoff formula and minimum wavelength.</li>
      <li>Study the dual nature of matter focusing on De Broglie wavelength.</li>
      <li>Practice calculations involving electron wavelength and diffraction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mt-6 mb-4">Day 13-14: Practice and Revision</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      By now, you should revise all formulas, key concepts, and theory notes thoroughly. Spend these two days:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-800">
      <li>Solving previous 10 years’ JEE questions on Modern Physics.</li>
      <li>Attempting mock tests to simulate exam conditions.</li>
      <li>Identifying weak areas and revisiting tough topics.</li>
      <li>Memorizing critical formulae and their derivations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mt-6 mb-4">Day 15: Final Review and Strategy</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Use this day to consolidate your knowledge:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-800">
      <li>Review flashcards of formulas and key points.</li>
      <li>Take a quick quiz covering all subtopics.</li>
      <li>Plan how to attempt Modern Physics questions efficiently during the exam.</li>
      <li>Relax and maintain confidence – your preparation is solid!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mt-6 mb-4">Additional Tips for Success</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6 text-gray-800">
      <li><strong>Conceptual Clarity:</strong> Modern Physics demands strong understanding rather than rote learning.</li>
      <li><strong>Formula Mastery:</strong> Know the derivations and applications, not just the formulas.</li>
      <li><strong>Practice Smart:</strong> Solve problems of varying difficulty to improve speed and accuracy.</li>
