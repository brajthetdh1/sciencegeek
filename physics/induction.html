    <h1>JEE Physics: Electromagnetic Induction Complete Guide</h1>

    <p>
      Electromagnetic induction is a pivotal topic in JEE Physics that connects electricity and magnetism. It explains how changing magnetic fields produce electric currents, which is foundational for many electrical devices. This guide covers Faraday's laws, Lenz's law, self and mutual induction, eddy currents, energy in magnetic fields, and real-world applications, supported by essential formulas and examples.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Introduction to Electromagnetic Induction</h2>
    <p>
      Electromagnetic induction refers to the phenomenon where an electromotive force (emf) is generated in a conductor due to a changing magnetic flux through it. This principle is fundamental in transformers, electric generators, inductors, and many other devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      The discovery of electromagnetic induction by Michael Faraday in 1831 revolutionized physics and technology.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Magnetic Flux and Its Change</h2>
    <p>
      Magnetic flux \(\Phi_B\) through a surface of area \(A\) in a magnetic field \(\vec{B}\) is:
    </p>
    <div class="formula">
      $$\Phi_B = \int \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{A} = B A \cos \theta$$
    </div>
    <p>
      Here, \(\theta\) is the angle between the magnetic field and the normal to the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      Electromagnetic induction occurs only when this flux changes with time, either by changing \(B\), area \(A\), or \(\theta\).
    </p>

    <h2>3. Faraday’s Laws of Electromagnetic Induction</h2>
    <h3>3.1 Faraday’s First Law</h3>
    <p>
      Whenever the magnetic flux linked with a circuit changes, an emf is induced in the circuit.
    </p>

    <h3>3.2 Faraday’s Second Law</h3>
    <p>
      The magnitude of the induced emf \(\mathcal{E}\) in a circuit is equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the circuit.
    </p>
    <div class="formula">
      $$\mathcal{E} = \left| \frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} \right|$$
    </div>
    <p>
      For a coil with \(N\) turns:
    </p>
    <div class="formula">
      $$\mathcal{E} = \left| N \frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} \right|$$
    </div>

    <h2>4. Lenz’s Law</h2>
    <p>
      Lenz’s law states that the direction of the induced emf (and hence current) is such that it opposes the change in magnetic flux that produced it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a manifestation of the conservation of energy principle.
    </p>
    <div class="formula">
      $$\mathcal{E} = -N \frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}$$
    </div>
    <p>
      The negative sign indicates opposition.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Motional emf</h2>
    <p>
      Consider a conductor of length \(l\) moving at velocity \(v\) perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field \(B\). The motional emf generated is:
    </p>
    <div class="formula">
      $$\mathcal{E} = B l v$$
    </div>
    <p>
      This emf can drive current if the conductor is part of a closed circuit.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Eddy Currents</h2>
    <p>
      Eddy currents are induced currents in bulk conductors when subjected to changing magnetic fields. They create magnetic fields opposing the change, causing energy loss as heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eddy currents are minimized by laminating transformer cores and using magnetic materials with high resistivity.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Self Induction</h2>
    <p>
      When current in a coil changes, the changing magnetic flux through the coil induces an emf in itself opposing the change. This phenomenon is called self-induction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Self-induced emf:
    </p>
    <div class="formula">
      $$\mathcal{E}_L = -L \frac{dI}{dt}$$
    </div>
    <p>
      Where \(L\) is the self-inductance of the coil (in Henry, H).
    </p>
    <p>
      Inductance depends on coil geometry, number of turns, and core material.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Mutual Induction</h2>
    <p>
      When the current in one coil changes, it induces emf in a nearby coil. This effect is mutual induction.
    </p>
    <div class="formula">
      $$\mathcal{E}_2 = -M \frac{dI_1}{dt}$$
    </div>
    <p>
      Where \(M\) is mutual inductance (Henry), and \(I_1\) is the current in the primary coil.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Energy Stored in Magnetic Field of an Inductor</h2>
    <p>
      Energy stored in an inductor carrying current \(I\):
    </p>
    <div class="formula">
      $$U = \frac{1}{2} L I^2$$
    </div>
    <p>
      This energy is stored in the magnetic field created by the current.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Applications of Electromagnetic Induction</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Electric Generators:</strong> Convert mechanical energy into electrical energy using Faraday’s law.</li>
      <li><strong>Transformers:</strong> Transfer electrical energy between circuits at different voltages using mutual induction.</li>
      <li><strong>Inductors:</strong> Components that store energy in magnetic fields, useful in circuits.</li>
      <li><strong>Eddy Current Brakes:</strong> Use eddy currents to produce braking force.</li>
      <li><strong>Metal Detectors:</strong> Detect metal objects by changes in induced currents.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>11. Faraday’s Disk Generator</h2>
    <p>
      A rotating conducting disk in a magnetic field generates emf across its radius due to motional induction.
    </p>
    <div class="formula">
      $$\mathcal{E} = \frac{1}{2} B \omega R^2$$
    </div>
    <p>
      Where \(\omega\) is angular velocity and \(R\) radius of disk.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Induced Electric Field</h2>
    <p>
      Changing magnetic flux induces a non-conservative electric field. The emf in a closed path \(C\) is:
    </p>
    <div class="formula">
      $$\oint_C \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l} = - \frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}$$
    </div>
    <p>
      Unlike electrostatic fields, induced electric fields can do net work around a closed path.
    </p>

    <h2>13. Mathematical Treatment: Maxwell-Faraday Equation</h2>
    <p>
      Maxwell’s equations relate changing magnetic fields to induced electric fields:
    </p>
    <div class="formula">
      $$\nabla \times \vec{E} = -\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t}$$
    </div>
